# ECG-Project
## Dataset
PhysioNet PTB-XL, a large publicly available of 12-lead electrocardiography dataset:
https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/
## Tasks
1.Age estimation - regression 

2.Cardiac arrhyth-mia diagnosis - Classification 
## Architecture - based on 'Automatic diagnosis of the 12-lead ECG using a deep neural network' by Ribeiro, Ant√¥nio H et-al
Original model was built with Tensorflow and we recreated it using Pytorch
